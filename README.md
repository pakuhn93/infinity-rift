# Infinity-Rift

## Description

Have you ever wanted to test the boundaries of what you know about elements? Ever wanted to reach places you never thought you could go? Imagine having the power to save the world and become the avatar, all in one hand. We created this application to tackle all of those problems. Using the power of MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS, we have created the ultimate card game for everyone to enjoy.

## Installation

To use this application, make sure you have NodeJS as well as MongoDB Compass installed on your computer. Next, clone the github repository into your local machine, and in your command-line application, run npm i to install all dependencies. Finally, run the command npm run develop and you can finally get your game on.

## Usage

Upon entering the application you will be greeted with the homepage.

You have a variety of options to choose from, including the About, GitHub, and Login/Signup buttons located in the header and footer. To play the game, you must first login, so click the "Must Be Logged In To Play!" button.

From there, you will be on the login page, and if you do not have a login you must first signup, which you can do so by hitting the signup button.

After logging in, click the "Game Start" button in the middle to start playing the game.

To play, you must first select your deck given any of the options on your screen.

Once in the game, you must battle your opponent by selecting which card you want to play. If you need to learn the rules of the game, you can click on the "Rules" button on the top left at any point on the website. Whoever has more score after the last card is played is determined the winner, and in the case that both players scores are equal, it will be considered a tie.

From there, you have the option to play again, or logout.
